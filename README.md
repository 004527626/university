# docFS: A DOS-ish File System

## Introduction

docFS is a DOS-ish virtual filesystem built on a virtual disk. It is being developed as a project for CSE 350 (File Systems) at CSU, San Bernardino. It is in no way complete.

## Warning

The code here is in no way complete, and shouldn't be used on any project right now. It is just a public record of my work.

In fact, the code does not currently build, and the tests are woefully incomplete. This is kept here as a reminder for me, and it makes discussing my code with other students quite easy. Don't use this, it doesn't work, and isn't particularly nice at all.
