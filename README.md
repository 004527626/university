# docFS: A DOS-ish File System

## Introduction

docFS is a DOS-ish virtual filesystem built on a virtual disk. It is being developed as a project for CSE 350 (File Systems) at CSU, San Bernardino. It is in no way complete.

## Warning

The code here is in no way complete, and shouldn't be used on any project right now. It is just a public record of my work.
